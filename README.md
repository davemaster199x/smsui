# SMSUI

SMSUI is a real-time messaging interface that leverages WebSocket technology to provide instant message sending and receiving capabilities, similar to platforms like Slack.

## Features

- Real-time message delivery via WebSocket connection
- Automatic message synchronization
- Instant notifications for new messages
- Seamless integration with existing messaging systems
- Support for both individual and group conversations

## Technical Overview

SMSUI establishes a persistent WebSocket connection to enable real-time bidirectional communication between the client and server. This allows for:

- Instant message delivery without polling
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Event-based message processing
- Efficient server resource usage

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```
3. Copy the configuration file:
```bash
cp config.php.sample config.php
```
4. Configure your WebSocket settings in `config.php`

## WebSocket Integration

The system maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to enable real-time messaging:

1. Client establishes WebSocket connection
2. Server authenticates the connection
3. Messages are sent and received automatically through the socket
4. Connection is monitored for health and automatically reconnected if needed

Example WebSocket event handling:

```javascript
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
    handleIncomingMessage(message);
};

socket.onclose = () => {
    // Automatic reconnection logic
    reconnectWebSocket();
};
```

## Configuration

Key configuration options in `config.php`:

- WebSocket server URL
- Authentication settings
- Message retry parameters
- Connection timeout values
- Logging preferences
